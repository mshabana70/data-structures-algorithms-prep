# Monkey Theorem using Hill Climbing (Genetic) Algorithm
#
# How does the Hill Climbing Algorithm work
# (Can be broken down into four simple steps)
#
# 1. Start with an empty or random solution. This is called our best solution 
# 2. Make a copy of the solution and mutate it slightly
# 3. Evaluate the new solution. If it's better than the best solution, we replace the best solution with this one.
# 4. Go to step two and repeat
#
# This can be done in three functions
#
# 1. Create a random solution
# 2. Evaluate a solution and return a score
# 3. Mutate a solution in a random way
